GameLauncher
============

### Q: What does it do?

GameLauncher, well, not to put too fine a point on it, launches games.

### Q: Why do I have to use it?

It's important to point out initially that nobody is forcing you to use this application. If you don't like it, don't use it. Perhaps a more appropriate question would be "Why would I want to use it?"

### Q: Ok, Why would I want to use it?

Now we're getting somewhere.

Who wants to use a game launcher? It's fine to just double click on the icon from the Finder right? Right!

But err... most games need as much processor power as they can use right? Right.

So before launching the game you need to quit as many programs as you can, and of course (because you are using a Macintosh instead of the other junk) you have several days worth of work open! And 15-20 applications running? And it would take you several precious gaming minutes to close and save all these applications, let alone open them all up again after you finish... Who needs the hassle, right? Right?

...Well this is where GameLauncher comes in handy. With GameLauncher these are the steps to gaming bliss:

1. GameLauncher first requires that you select the desired game*
2. Enable/Disable applications from the process listing
3. Press the "Launch" button

GameLauncher will quit all the applications you have selected, launch the game, wait patiently until you are finished, then return the applications to your desktop good as new. Less time wasted, more game-play time maximised. Neat right? Right!

\* **Note:** the application selected does not have to be a game. If you need to maximise processor time for another application of choice - go right ahead.


### Q: Is there a Pro version? 

Not at this point it time. Since GameLauncher is Open Source (TM) please feel free to add these features yourself. Any sufficiently decent code added to the application and I will include your name in the copyright/developers section.

We did have plans to make a "Pro" version with the following features, (but interest was not forthcoming):

- launch games from a menu bar item.
- maintain a list of all your games in one place, so you can find them quickly and easily. 
- contains no advertising "nag-screens".
- allows you to create a double-clickable "gamelaunch" file, which quits all non essential applications and launches the desired application, then returns the state after you are finished.
- re-launches hidden applications, hidden.
- retains a list of possible "states" - applications open - so that you can quickly get back to work.

### Q: Do you know of any way to make my friends jealous with text formatting? 

What a terrible question. But you asked for it, so here it is:

### Q: Some people think that sheep...

That's not a question, but, yes, we know.
